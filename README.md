# Collaborative-Story-Creation-Tool
user stories: i. A user signs into their online account, edits an existing or creates a new story and saves this story in an online database. 
For now, a story has a title, a main text and contextual annotation in the form of tags.  
A story can have multiple co-called snapshots (organised as an ordered list) that represent selective key events in that story 
that are especially important (e.g. an assembly of people or a disastrous event) and that could be drawn as a painting.   
For now, the snapshot is represented as a text. Each of these snapshots can have multiple links to resources (e.g. to 3D objects, Wikipedia articles scribing locations or people, 
pictures etc.) that are part of this snapshot.  ii. Users may wish to collaborate in the creation and modification of stories.
All users do have access to all stories for viewing and editing, however, a story (with associated snapshots and resources) 
can only be edited by one user at any time. If a user edits, others can only view.  iii. A central log is kept that keeps record of all views and edits 
made with information about time, users and actions.
